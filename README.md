Welcome to the Stick War 2 User Control Mod made by AsePlayer!

This mod features everyone's favorite classic mechanic from Stick War 1, the ability to totally control one overpowered unit, reimagined in Stick War 2! 

Press Tab to control a Unit! Use WASD/arrow keys to move and spacebar to attack in order to defeat this super challenging campaign, featuring tougher enemies with each increasing difficulty! Fear not, for User Control becomes a stronger presence in the battlefield as difficulties increase as well! More upgrade points will also surely aid you in your quest!

Good luck and have fun! I hope you enjoy the Stick War 2 User Control Mod!
