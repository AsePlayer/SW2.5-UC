# SW2.5-UC
Welcome to the Stick War 2.5: User Control Mod made by AsePlayer!

This mod features everyone's favorite classic mechanic from Stick War, the ability to completely control one overpowered unit, reimagined in Stick War 2! 

Press F to control a Unit! Use WASD/arrow keys to move and spacebar to attack nearby Units in order to defeat this super challenging campaign, featuring tougher enemies with each increasing difficulty! Fear not, for User Control becomes a stronger presence in the battlefield as difficulties increase as well! More upgrade points will also surely aid you in your quest to reunite Inamorta and defeat the Chaos Empire!

Good luck and have fun! I hope you enjoy the Stick War 2.5: User Control Mod!
Made with lots of love :)
